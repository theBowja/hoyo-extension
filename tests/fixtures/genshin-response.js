This effect can trigger once every 8s.\\n\\nUsing the Elemental Skill <color=#FFD780FF>Dawnfrost Darkstar</color> will reset Stellar Blade stacks.\\nAdditionally, when Citlali is using her leap, or is Aiming or using her Charged Attack in mid-air, her Phlogiston consumption is decreased by 45%.",

DMG dealt this way is considered Normal Attack DMG.\\n·When she makes contact with opponents in this state, Mualani applies \"Marked as Prey\" to them and gains 1 Wave Momentum stack. Max 3 stacks. 1 stack can be gained from the same opponent every 0.7s.\\n\\n<color=#FFD780FF>Wave Momentum and Marked as Prey</color>\\nWhen Mualani uses Sharky's Bite, her DMG dealt increases based on Wave Momentum stacks. When she has 3 stacks, Sharky's Bite will be converted to Sharky's Surging Bite, further increasing her DMG and removing all her stacks when hitting an opponent.\\nWhen Sharky's Bite hits an opponent Marked as Prey, that mark will be removed, and she will fire Shark Missiles at up to 5 nearby opponents Marked as Prey, dealing DMG to them equal to this Sharky's Bite instance and clearing their Marks. If more than 1 opponent is the target of Sharky's Bite and Shark Missiles, the DMG dealt will decrease, decreasing at most to 72% of the original DMG when 3 opponents are targeted.\\n\\n<i>First off, Sharky is a freshwater shark on top of being a surfboard. Second, it's not that it wants to eat for real, just that it definitely bites for real.</i>",

When the active character is currently in the air, the following will trigger when switching to Ororon: Ororon will leap up high. Nightsoul Transmission can be triggered once every 10s by your party.\\n\\nHolding Aiming Mode will cause Ororon to enter the \"Spiritspeaker\" state, which will allow him to interact with \"Nightspirit Graffiti\" and \"Nightspirit Sigils,\" extracting information and power from them. The rules for interacting with these objects follow the same rules as those governing Iktomisaurus interactions.\\n\\nAdditionally, holding the jump button will cause Ororon to consume 75 Stamina and leap. In areas within Natlan where Phlogiston mechanics are present, Ororon will prioritize consuming 5 Phlogiston to leap to a height higher still.\\nWhen in the air, Ororon can Hold his Normal Attack to consume Phlogiston or Stamina and enter Aiming Mode.",
